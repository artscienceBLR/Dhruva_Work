These are the settings I used for repetier host to run the 3D printer. 

Connection

Baud Rate: 115200
Stop bits: 1
Parity: none
Transfer Protocol: autodetect
Receive Chache Size: 63
Timeout: 40
Ping Pong: False
Firmware sends OK: True

Behavior

Travel Feedrate: 7000 mm/min
Z axis Travel Feedrate: 1000 mm/min
Default Extruder Temp: 200 ºC
Default Heated Bed Temp: 0 ºC
Number of Extruders: 1
Rest of the settings are Default

Dimensions: (very important settings. Printer can get damaged if incorrect)

Home X: x = 0
Home Y: y = 0
Home Z: Z = Zmax (starts printing at Z = 0, homes to Z = Zmax)
Xmin: -85 mm (build volume diameter = 170, radius = 85 mm)
Xmax: 115 mm (actually 85, but my software does not allow below 115. Ignore)
Ymin: -85 mm
Ymax: 115 mm (same as above)
Printer Type: delta with cylindrical print shape
Diameter: 170 mm
Height: 154*
*This value changes every time you level the bed. Essentially, the print area needs to be a
 perfect cylinder, which means that the plane of the home points needs to be perfectly 
 paralell to the printing plane. This requires you to manually move the extruder around 
 horizontally and put paper under the legs of the circular build platform to lift it and
 make it horizontal with respect to the horizontal motion of the extruder. As a consequence, 
 you also need to choose an appropriate Z height to make sure the printer prints JUST above
 the build plate. This Z height must be changed in both repetier and in the firmware, the latter
 requiring you to upload to the arduino everytime you change it (unless you figure out EEPROM).
 
Advanced: 

Nothing

Note: I personally found that printing using simplify3D gives the best prints and least hassle.
      However, it is an expensive software unless you find another way of getting it ;)
      Naturally, you can use the machine settings (dimensions, feedrate etc) on the other software.
